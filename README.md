# 🚀 SQL Mastery - Interview & Assessment Ready

A comprehensive SQL learning repository structured to take you from fundamentals to advanced interview-level queries. This repo follows a systematic roadmap designed for cracking SQL rounds in interviews and online assessments.

---

## 📚 Learning Structure

This repository is divided into **3 progressive phases**, each building upon the previous one.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Concepts** 🌱
*Building blocks of SQL - Master the basics*

- Data Types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.)
- Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT)
- SQL Command Types (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
- Basic Queries (SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT/TOP)
- Aggregations & Grouping (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING)

---

### **Phase 2: Intermediate Queries & Joins** 🔗
*Combining data and writing real-world queries*

- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF JOIN)
- Subqueries (Single-row, Multi-row, Correlated)
- Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
- Advanced SELECT (CASE WHEN, COALESCE, NULLIF, EXISTS)

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced SQL & Interview Patterns** 🎯
*Master the concepts asked in 90% of SQL interviews*

- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, PARTITION BY)
- Complex Patterns (Top-N per group, Gaps & Islands, Duplicate detection)
- Schema-based Real-world Queries (Orders-Customers-Products)
- Query Optimization (EXPLAIN plans, Indexes, Best practices)

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. **Follow the Phase Order** - Start from Phase 1, don't skip ahead
2. **Practice Each File** - Run queries, modify them, break them to understand
3. **Do the Practice Files** - These simulate real interview questions
4. **Build Your Own Queries** - After each concept, try variations
5. **Track Your Progress** - Mark files as complete once you're confident

---

## 💡 Interview Focus Areas

Based on the roadmap, these topics appear most frequently in interviews:

- ✅ **Joins** (INNER, LEFT, SELF) - 40% of interview questions
- ✅ **Window Functions** (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY) - 30%
- ✅ **Subqueries & CTEs** - 20%
- ✅ **Aggregations with GROUP BY** - 10%

---

## 📖 Roadmap Reference

This repository follows the **SQL Roadmap for Interviews & Online Assessments** (see `road_map.pdf`), ensuring comprehensive coverage of all interview topics.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Practice

- Use any SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)
- Each `.sql` file is standalone and includes sample data where needed
- Practice queries can be run directly or modified for experimentation

---

## 🎓 Learning Tips

- **Write, Don't Just Read** - Type every query yourself
- **Understand, Don't Memorize** - Know WHY a query works
- **Practice Daily** - Consistency beats intensity
- **Build Real Scenarios** - Think about actual business problems

---

## 🚧 Repository Status

**Current Progress:** Phase 1 in progress  
**Next Up:** Phase 2 - Joins & Subqueries  
**Target:** Complete all 3 phases for interview readiness
