# 🚀 SQL Mastery - Interview & Assessment Ready

A comprehensive SQL learning repository structured to take you from fundamentals to advanced interview-level queries. This repo follows a systematic roadmap designed for cracking SQL rounds in interviews and online assessments.

---

## 📚 Learning Structure

This repository is divided into **3 progressive phases**, each building upon the previous one.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Concepts** 🌱
*Building blocks of SQL - Master the basics*

- **01_data_types.sql** - Understanding SQL data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.)
- **02_constraints.sql** - Primary Key, Foreign Key, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT
- **03_sql_cmds_types.sql** - DDL, DML, DCL, TCL command categories
- **04_basic_queries.sql** - SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT/TOP
- **05_practise_basic_queries.sql** - Practice: Top N queries, filtering multiple conditions
- **06_Aggregations_&_Grouping.sql** - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING
- **07_practise_aggreagtions_and_grouping.sql** - Practice: Department stats, customer counts

---

### **Phase 2: Intermediate Queries & Joins** 🔗
*Combining data and writing real-world queries*

- **Joins** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF JOIN)
  - Practice: Employee-Manager relationships, Customers with/without orders
- **Subqueries** (Single-row, Multi-row, Correlated)
  - Practice: Above average salaries, unprocessed orders
- **Set Operations** (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
  - Practice: Data comparison queries
- **Advanced SELECT** (CASE WHEN, COALESCE, NULLIF, EXISTS)
  - Practice: Conditional categorization

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced SQL & Interview Patterns** 🎯
*Master the concepts asked in 90% of SQL interviews*

- **Window Functions** (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, PARTITION BY)
  - Running totals, moving averages
  - Practice: Nth highest salary per department
- **Complex Patterns**
  - Top-N per group
  - Gaps & Islands (finding continuous/missing sequences)
  - Duplicate detection & removal
- **Schema-based Real-world Queries**
  - Orders-Customers-Products multi-table scenarios
  - Revenue analysis, inactive users, product analytics
- **Query Optimization**
  - EXPLAIN plans, Indexes, Best practices

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. **Follow the Phase Order** - Start from Phase 1, don't skip ahead
2. **Practice Each File** - Run queries, modify them, break them to understand
3. **Do the Practice Files** - These simulate real interview questions
4. **Build Your Own Queries** - After each concept, try variations
5. **Track Your Progress** - Mark files as complete once you're confident

---

## 💡 Interview Focus Areas

Based on the roadmap, these topics appear most frequently in interviews:

- ✅ **Joins** (INNER, LEFT, SELF) - 40% of interview questions
- ✅ **Window Functions** (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY) - 30%
- ✅ **Subqueries & CTEs** - 20%
- ✅ **Aggregations with GROUP BY** - 10%

---

## 📖 Roadmap Reference

This repository follows the **SQL Roadmap for Interviews & Online Assessments** (see `road_map.pdf`), ensuring comprehensive coverage of all interview topics.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Practice

- Use any SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)
- Each `.sql` file is standalone and includes sample data where needed
- Practice queries can be run directly or modified for experimentation

---

## 🎓 Learning Tips

- **Write, Don't Just Read** - Type every query yourself
- **Understand, Don't Memorize** - Know WHY a query works
- **Practice Daily** - Consistency beats intensity
- **Build Real Scenarios** - Think about actual business problems

---

## 🚧 Repository Status

**Current Progress:** Phase 1 in progress  
**Next Up:** Phase 2 - Joins & Subqueries  
**Target:** Complete all 3 phases for interview readiness

**Happy Learning! 🎉**  
*Master SQL, one query at a time.*
